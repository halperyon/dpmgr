***dpmgr*** is a helper script for [dpass](http://github.com/disc-8/dpass) that makes it behave more like a traditional password manager, while still not actually storing the passwords on your drive.

# Features
* Passwords not stored
* Minimal, easy to use CLI
* Extremely secure, even if someone cracks the encryption on the files, they don't have your passwords
  * (unless they got the password, and you reused it as the master password. you're fucked in that case lol)
## KNOWN FLAWS
* Entry and category names aren't obscured, but it's really a nothingburger even if your PC gets compromised. You got more things to worry about then than the attacker knowing what kind of freaky midget porno sites you have accounts on.
